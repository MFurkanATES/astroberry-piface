# astroberry-piface
Astroberry PiFace is a successor of Astroberry project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/astroberry/)
Astroberry PiFace provides a set of INDI drivers for PiFace addon boards to Raspberry Pi:
- PiFace Relay Plus,
- PiFace Motor Extra,
- PiFace Control and Display
- Astroberry GPS
- Astroberry AltIMU
- 
So what's the deal with Astroberry PiFace vs. Astroberry projects?
Astroberry project is based on custom addon board, which required some understanding of electronics and soldering skills to build. To make things easier and let anybody use Raspberry Pi as a INDI server new project was created. Astroberry PiFace is based on hardware already available on market, so all you need is to put the tiles together, grab the software and you're ready to go.
